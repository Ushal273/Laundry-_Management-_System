This system is hosted on 000webhostapp and is designed to efficiently manage laundry orders, track inventory, handle customer information, and generate invoices. Through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have created a user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth experience for users. The backend is powered by PHP and MySQL, which
